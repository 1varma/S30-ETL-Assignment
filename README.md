## You can just access the S30 ETL Assignment.db using sqlite3 though Python.

## I attached the ETL_Assignment_PYTHON.ipynb notebook to extract the desired output on DataFrames
## I attached the ETL_Assignment_SQL.ipynb notebook to extract the desired output using SQL

## So the outputs are retreived from respective methods and stored as per the naming conventions as csv files delimited with ';'
